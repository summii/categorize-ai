# Product Categorization with OpenAI

This project aims to assign categories to product information using Google taxonomy and OpenAI. It is designed primarily for e-commerce applications but can be adapted for other text classification tasks given the appropriate taxonomy.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:summii/categorize-ai.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**:
   ```bash
   cd categorize-ai
   ```
3. **Build and run the application using Docker:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

This will start the necessary containers, including the application and the database. The application will connect to the PostgreSQL database and handle data insertion and retrieval.
